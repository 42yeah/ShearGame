## Shear 3D

__WARNING: slight swears are present in this game!__

(See, this is what happens when you punch the rich man in the face when he's eating!)

Shear 3D is  the remake of ShearGame, a game which I made long before. It's like the first game I've ever made. It utilizes ImGui!

And now because of the incoming 7DRL practicing and other reasons, I am remaking it out of nostalgia, or whatever reasons. Play it at your own risk!

## Building 

Well, we can't expect everybody to use Xcode, right? It sucks! So we use CMake from now on. To compile this project, all you need is:

- GLFW >= 3.2

and

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then you can

```sh
cd Shear3D
./Shear3D
```

and start playing!

## The story

Your father just commited suicide after losing a bet worth of 1000 eggs with the local rich man. It is now up to you to pay the debt. Luckily, you have a well which spurts infinite amount of gold coins at your backyard. When you get enough eggs, find the rich man, and fullfill your side of the deal!



## Meet other people

There are all sorts of people in the Shear Village, all of  them have their daily lives going on!

## Grind the money

The well has a buttload of money in it. So make full use of it! However, the rich man does not seek money. He seeks eggs...

## Romance! (maybe)

See a girl you like? Flirt with her! I might implement that one day.
